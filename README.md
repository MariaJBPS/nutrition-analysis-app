# Nutrition Analysis site

This is a simple app that provides nutritional information for common foods.

You can enter any food (for e.g.: _"1 egg"_ or _"For dinner I had steak with mash potatoes and peas"_) and get its nutritional facts such as calories, carbs, protein, and fats.

This app integrates the **Nutritionix Track API** to get detailed nutrient breakdown.
