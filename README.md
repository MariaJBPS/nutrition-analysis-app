# Nutrition Analysis site

This is a simple vite app that provides nutritional information for common foods.

You can enter any food (for e.g.: _"1 egg"_ or _"For dinner I had steak with mash potatoes and peas"_) and get its nutritional facts such as calories, carbs, protein, and fats.

This app integrates the **Nutritionix Track API** to get detailed nutrient breakdown. 

For more information on this API, follow this link: https://developer.nutritionix.com/docs/v2
